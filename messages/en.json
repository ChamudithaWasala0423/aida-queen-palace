Rooted in a legacy of excellence in the gem and jewellery business, Mr. Weerasena embarked on a remarkable journey, single-handedly crafting the AIDA brand into a symbol of quality and innovation. The genesis of AIDA finds its inspiration in the world of German opera, a nod to the invaluable support extended by German tourists during the nascent stages of the business. Fuelled by a relentless spirit and an unwavering commitment to excellence, Mr. Weerasena forged enduring relationships and cultivated a sterling reputation within the industry. Drawing from the rich tapestry of experience in the gem and jewellery trade, AIDA swiftly diversified its portfolio, transcending boundaries and venturing into new horizons. From the glittering world of gems, the AIDA brand seamlessly expanded into the vibrant realms of tourism, gastronomy, textiles, and the rejuvenating sanctuary of Ayurvedic hospitality.",
